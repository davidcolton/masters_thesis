Several scholarly communities are addressing how to detect and manage such content: research in computer vision focuses on detection of inappropriate images, natural language processing technology has advanced to recognize insults. However, profanity detection systems remain flawed. Current list-based profanity detection systems have two limitations. First, they are easy to circumvent and easily become stale - that is, they cannot adapt to misspellings, abbreviations, and the fast pace of profane slang evolution. Secondly, they offer a one-size fits all solution; they typically do not accommodate domain, community and context specific needs. However, social settings have their own normative behaviors - what is deemed acceptable in one community may not be in another. In this paper, through analysis of comments from a social news site, we provide evidence that current systems are performing poorly and evaluate the cases on which they fail. We then address community differences regarding creation/tolerance of profanity and suggest a shift to more contextually nuanced profanity detection systems.},

Introduction Very large databases with skewed class distributions and non-uniform cost per error are not uncommon in real-world data mining tasks. One such task is credit card fraud detection: the number of fraudulent transactions is small compared to legitimate ones, the amount of financial loss for each fraudulent transaction depends on the amount of transaction and other factors, and millions of transactions occur each day. A similar task is cellular phone fraud detection (Fawcett \& Provost 1997). Each of these three issues has not been widely studied in the machine learning research community.

By representing four available data sets with these features, we try to find hints about how to deal with this unexplored task from a computational point of view. Our findings are assessed by human annotators in two strata: isolated sentences and entire documents. The results show how complex and subjective the task of automatically detecting irony could be.},

The results presented in this article are two-fold. Our first experiments were designed to develop an understanding of both the specific words that are used by cyberbullies, and the context surrounding these words. We have identified the most commonly used cyberbullying terms, and have developed queries that can be used to detect cyberbullying content. Five of our queries achieve an average precision of 91.25\% at rank 100. In our second set of experiments we extended this work by using a supervised machine learning approach for detecting cyberbullying. The machine learning experiments identify additional terms that are consistent with cyberbullying content, and identified an additional querying technique that was able to accurately assign scores to posts from Formspring.me. The posts with the highest scores are shown to have a high density of cyberbullying content.},

For simplicity, we consider only problems where c(x) is either positive or negative, and all attributes are continuous.

These forms of aggression are known by 3 different names: indirect aggression, relational aggression, and social aggression. This review examines their commonalities and differences, and concludes that they are essentially the same form of aggression. We show that analogous forms are not found in other species. We offer a functional account: indirect aggression is an alternative strategy to direct aggression, enacted when the costs of direct aggression are high, and whose aim is to socially exclude, or harm the social status of, a victim. In this light, we consider sex differences and developmental trends and the impact of this aggression on victims. We conclude that indirect, relational, and social aggression are much more similar than they are different, and we suggest ways in which future research can be facilitated by integrating the three areas under an adaptive framework.},

Social networking sites provide a fertile medium for bullies, and teens and young adults who use these sites are vulnerable to attacks. Through machine learning, we can detect language patterns used by bullies and their victims, and develop rules to automatically detect cyber bullying content. The data we used for our project was collected from the website Formspring.me, a question-and-answer formatted website that contains a high percentage of bullying content. The data was labeled using a web service, Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We used the labeled data, in conjunction with machine learning techniques provided by the Weka tool kit, to train a computer to recognize bullying content. Both a C4.5 decision tree learner and an instance-based learner were able to identify the true positives with 78.5\% accuracy.},

However, countless number of such data makes the job an uphill task. This paper presents a research aiming to develop a systematic approach to Online Patrol by automatically spotting suspicious entries and reporting them to {PTA} members and therefore help them do their job. We present some of the ﬁrst results of analysis of the inappropriate data collected from unofﬁcial school Web sites. The analysis is performed ﬁrstly with an {SVM} based machine learning method to detect the inappropriate entries.

	volume = {2},
	doi = {10.1109/ICMLA.2012.162},
	abstract = {In the last decade, class imbalance has attracted a huge amount of attention from researchers and practitioners. Class imbalance is ubiquitous in Machine Learning, Data Mining and Pattern Recognition applications; therefore, these research communities have responded to such interest with literally dozens of methods and techniques. Surprisingly, there are still many fundamental open-ended questions such as "Are all learning paradigms equally affected by class imbalance?", "What is the expected performance loss for different imbalance degrees?" and "How much of the performance losses can be recovered by the treatment methods?". In this paper, we propose a simple experimental design to assess the performance of class imbalance treatment methods. This experimental setup uses real data sets with artificially modified class distributions to evaluate classifiers in a wide range of class imbalance. We employ such experimental design in a large-scale experimental evaluation with twenty-two data sets and seven learning algorithms from different paradigms. Our results indicate that the expected performance loss, as a percentage of the performance obtained with the balanced distribution, is quite modest (below 5\%) for the most balanced distributions up to 10\% of minority examples. However, the loss tends to increase quickly for higher degrees of class imbalance, reaching 20\% for 1\% of minority class examples. Support Vector Machine is the classifier paradigm that is less affected by class imbalance, being almost insensitive to all but the most imbalanced distributions. Finally, we show that the sampling algorithms only partially recover the performance losses. On average, typically about 30\% or less of the performance that was lost due to class imbalance was recovered by random over-sampling and {SMOTE}.},

These communities provide places for information sharing and collaboration. They also open the door for inappropriate online activities, such as harassment, in which some users post messages in a virtual community that are intentionally offensive to other members of the community. It is a new and challenging task to detect online harassment; currently few systems attempt to solve this problem. In this paper, we use a supervised learning approach for detecting harassment. Our technique employs content features, sentiment features, and contextual features of documents. The experimental results described herein show that our method achieves significant improvements over several baselines, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency ({TFIDF}) approaches. Identification of online harassment is feasible when {TFIDF} is supplemented with sentiment and contextual feature attributes.},

Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of oversampling the minority (abnormal)cla ss and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in {ROC} space)tha n only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in {ROC} space)t han varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier.

Now, as increasingly complex real-world problems are addressed, rarity, and the related problem of imbalanced data, are taking center stage. This article discusses the role that rare classes and rare cases play in data mining. The problems that can result from these two forms of rarity are described in detail, as are methods for addressing these problems. These descriptions utilize examples from existing research. So that this article provides a good survey of the literature on rarity in data mining. This article also demonstrates that rare classes and rare cases are very similar phenomena—both forms of rarity are shown to cause similar problems during data mining and benefit from the same remediation methods.},

More generally, it is found that even in formal writing, female writing exhibits greater usage of features identified by previous researchers as \&quot;involved \&quot; while male writing exhibits greater usage of features which have been identified as \&quot;informational\&quot;.

The current paper takes a complementary approach, which attempts to minimise the amount of occurrences of cyber bullying in the first place. The approach consists of a system of normative agents, which are physically present in a virtual society. The agents, which reason based on a {BDI}-model, use a number of techniques to detect various norm violations, including insulting and following. By using rewards and punishments, they try to reinforce the desired behaviour of the users. The system has been implemented and tested within a virtual environment for children between 6 and 12 years old, called Club Time Machine. In a real world experiment, the behaviour of the users of the virtual environment has been logged and analysed by means of a logic-based checking tool. The results show that the normative agents have the potential to reduce the amount of norm violations on the long term.},

	abstract = {Cyberbullying (harassment on social networks) is widely recognized as a serious social problem, especially for adolescents. It is as much a threat to the viability of online social networks for youth today as spam once was to email in the early days of the Internet. Current work to tackle this problem has involved social and psychological studies on its prevalence as well as its negative effects on adolescents. While true solutions rest on teaching youth to have healthy personal relationships, few have considered innovative design of social network software as a tool for mitigating this problem. Mitigating cyberbullying involves two key components: robust techniques for effective detection and reflective user interfaces that encourage users to reflect upon their behavior and their choices. Spam filters have been successful by applying statistical approaches like Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models. They can, like Google’s {GMail}, aggregate human spam judgments because spam is sent nearly identically to many people. Bullying is more personalized, varied, and contextual. In this work, we present an approach for bullying detection based on state-of-the-art natural language processing and a common sense knowledge base, which permits recognition over a broad spectrum of topics in everyday life. We analyze a more narrow range of particular subject matter associated with bullying (e.g. appearance, intelligence, racial and ethnic slurs, social acceptance, and rejection), and construct {BullySpace}, a common sense knowledge base that encodes particular knowledge about bullying situations. We then perform joint reasoning with common sense knowledge about a wide range of everyday life topics. We analyze messages using our novel {AnalogySpace} common sense reasoning technique. We also take into account social network analysis and other factors. We evaluate the model on real-world instances that have been reported by users on Formspring, a social networking website that is popular with teenagers. On the intervention side, we explore a set of reflective user-interaction paradigms with the goal of promoting empathy among social network participants. We propose an “air traffic control”-like dashboard, which alerts moderators to large-scale outbreaks that appear to be escalating or spreading and helps them prioritize the current deluge of user complaints. For potential victims, we provide educational material that informs them about how to cope with the situation, and connects them with emotional support from others. A user evaluation shows that in-context, targeted, and dynamic help during cyberbullying situations fosters end-user reflection that promotes better coping strategies.},

The proposed framework is designed based on two hypotheses. First, a human relationship network can be constructed with some degree of accuracy from usage statistics of digital communication media. Second, risk factors for school bullying impose distinct structural features in a human relationship network. This paper presents the initial effort to empirically verify the hypotheses to lay the foundations for further design of the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Friendships, relationships and social communications have all gone to a new level with new definitions as a result of the invention of online social networks. Meanwhile, alongside this transition there is increasing evidence that online social applications have been used by children and adolescents for bullying. State-of-the-art studies in cyberbullying detection have mainly focused on the content of the conversations while largely ignoring the users involved in cyberbullying. We hypothesis that incorporation of the users’ profile, their characteristics, and post-harassing behaviour, for instance, posting a new status in another social network as a reaction to their bullying experience, will improve the accuracy of cyberbullying detection. Cross-system analyses of the users’ behaviour - monitoring users’ reactions in different online environments - can facilitate this process and could lead to more accurate detection of cyberbullying. This paper outlines the framework for this faceted approach.},

In chat conversations they may try to establish a connection and escalate the conversation towards a physical meeting. Till date no effective methods exist for quickly analyzing the contents, evolution over time, the present state and threat level of these chat conversations. In this paper we propose a novel method based on Temporal Relational Semantic Systems, the main structure in the temporal and relational version of Formal Concept Analysis. For rapidly gaining insight into the topics of chat conversations we combine a linguistic ontology for chatterms with conceptual scaling and represent the dynamics of chats by life tracks in nested line diagrams. To showcase the possibilities of our approach we used chat conversations of a private American organization which actively searches for pedophiles on the internet.},

We present a new method for sentiment classification based on extracting and analyzing appraisal groups such as “very good” or “not terribly funny”. An appraisal group is represented as a set of attribute values in several task-independent semantic taxonomies, based on Appraisal Theory. Semi-automated methods were used to build a lexicon of appraising adjectives and their modifiers. We classify movie reviews using features based upon these taxonomies combined with standard “bag-of-words” features, and report state-of-the-art accuracy of 90.2\%. In addition, we find that some types of appraisal appear to be more significant for sentiment classification than others.},

While other approaches seek merely to classify the overall topic of the text, we try to match stories to finer-grained ”scripts' that represent stereotypical events and actions. For example, many bullying stories can be matched to a ”revenge' script that describes trying to harm someone who has harmed you. These tools have been implemented in an initial prototype system and tested on a database of real stories of cyberbullying collected on {MTV}'s ”A Thin Line' Web site.},

Anonymity and the lack of meaningful supervision in the electronic medium are two factors that have exacerbated this social menace. Comments or posts involving sensitive topics that are personal to an individual are more likely to be internalized by a victim, often resulting in tragic outcomes. We decompose the overall detection problem into detection of sensitive topics, lending itself into text classification sub-problems. We experiment with a corpus of 4500 {YouTube} comments, applying a range of binary and multiclass classifiers. We find that binary classifiers for individual labels outperform multiclass classifiers. Our findings show that the detection of textual cyberbullying can be tackled by building individual topic-sensitive classifiers.}

Second, we discuss several basic re-sampling or cost-modifying methods previously proposed to deal with the class imbalance problem and compare their effectiveness. The results obtained by such methods on artificial domains are linked to results in real-world domains. Finally, we investigate the assumption that the class imbalance problem does not only affect decision tree systems but also affects other classification systems such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.},

The proliferation of mobile technologies available, in conjunction with applications facilitating social networking, has steadily increased the attack surface minors are exposed to in an online environment. Most minors engaging in online activities do so through mobile technologies such as the cell phone. This device, as a consequence of its mobility, offers access to the internet that circumvents controls of supervision. This paper presents an approach that offers an alternative to existing solutions, available to the commercial market, that are driven by static configurations.

	abstract = {Cyberbullying has recently emerged as a new form of bullying and harassment. 360 adolescents (12-20 years), were surveyed to examine the nature and extent of cyberbullying in Swedish schools. Four categories of cyberbullying (by text message, email, phone call and picture/video clip) were examined in relation to age and gender, perceived impact, telling others, and perception of adults becoming aware of such bullying. There was a significant incidence of cyberbullying in lower secondary schools, less in sixth-form colleges. Gender differences were few. The impact of cyberbullying was perceived as highly negative for picture/video clip bullying. Cybervictims most often chose to either tell their friends or no one at all about the cyberbullying, so adults may not be aware of cyberbullying, and (apart from picture/video clip bullying) this is how it was perceived by pupils. Findings are discussed in relation to similarities and differences between cyberbullying and the more traditional forms of bullying.},
