Repository for all things related to my MSc Thesis - Cyberbullying Detection With Python

As I add content I'll update the notes here so that people can get an idea of what each folder contains.

## Latex

The first folder I added was the Latex Folder. This folder contain _working_ Latex that builds the PDF version of my Thesis, **Detection of Cyberbullying using Python and Text Mining**. This thesis was accepted as the final part of my MSc in Business Intelligence and Data Mining (as it was called at the time). The course is now [Master of Science in Computing (Applied Data Science & Analytics)](https://www.itb.ie/StudyatITB/bn529.html) and more details are available [here](http://www.dataminingmasters.com/).

This folder also contains the a newly generated pdf version of the Thesis if you are interested in reading it.
